Here’s how you can structure your 3-page slideshow for SkillVault in a formal and elegant manner:


---

Slide 1: Why SkillVault? (Title Slide)

Key Challenges We Face:

No structured skill inventory for 4000+ TSO talents (Skills & Proficiency Levels for Production Deployment).

No centralized online view of open TSO requirements (JDs, skill mapping, required activities, and proficiency levels).

Training programs are not effectively mapped to skills (70+ PUs lack structured skill mapping).

No proper integration of training programs (Lex or customized) with actual skill needs.


Why It Matters:

Inefficient talent utilization due to missing skill visibility.

Difficulties in sourcing internally for open positions.

Lack of data-driven decisions in workforce planning & training investments.

Slide 2: The Benefits of SkillVault

How a Detailed Skill Inventory Helps:

Improved Talent Utilization – Clear view of unit-wide skill levels and internally fulfillable requirements.

Demand Analysis – Identify which skills are most needed in the current business landscape.

Optimized Training Investments – Insights into which trainings need focus for maximum impact.

Strategic Talent Deployment – Identify highly skilled talents not in SLR for SLR growth and strategic initiatives.


SkillVault will transform workforce planning by providing real-time visibility into skills, demands, and growth opportunities.
